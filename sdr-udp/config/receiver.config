# SDR UDP Receiver Configuration File
# This file configures the receiver's packet and chunk parameters

# Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) - packet payload size in bytes
# This is the size of each UDP packet payload (not including headers)
# Must be <= 1476 (1500 - 8 UDP header - 16 SDR packet header)
mtu_bytes=128

# Number of packets per chunk
# Controls how many packets are grouped into a single chunk
# For example: 4096 bytes with mtu_bytes=128 gives 32 packets
# With packets_per_chunk=16, you get 2 chunks
# With packets_per_chunk=32, you get 1 chunk
packets_per_chunk=32

# Transfer ID (optional, defaults to 1)
transfer_id=1
